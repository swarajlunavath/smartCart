# smartCart

The most valuable thing in today’s world is time, people are referring those things which consumes less time. Billing in Shopping mall takes lot of time. Billing of products from mall is quite difficult because it takes more time as people have to wait for a long time in a queue for billing .Looking at the advancement in technology, we came up with an innovative idea of “Smart Shopping Cart for Automatic Billing in Supermarket”. This project consists of android application with which we can add the items by scanning the bar code. After scanning the item, the item details are send to the micro controller in the trolley. The micro controller then compares the weight of items in the cart with the total calculated weight. 



In existing system, customer will not know the amount of total purchase, until he went to the counter for paying bill. The customer has to wait in the queue for billing to be done. To avoid these problems we have developed a smart cart which reduces the total time consumed during shopping



Our cart will provide a billing system with option of payment through app .
This cart consists of  a QR Code.
This QR code when scanned with app will be connected to that specific cart.
The cart consists of sensors to detect objects.
 And finally after completion of the shopping, a code will be generated by the app.
